Approach used in developing front end.

First of all I have used simple react not used redux because the app is not too complex,
not too much parent child dependencies.

I have used ant design library for userinterface designing also have do some custom designing.
I have save user coords which he select using geosuggestions , he can set location of all over,
world, and leave note on any location.

for backend I have make two models one for user and other for maps.
we can handle data in any way user locations or any else.
I have user react google map with its loader to display map with multiple markers and multiple
info windows where I have shown title and text of not every user can view location of notes added by other.

I have spend 13 hours to do that task.

proper react structure set with webpack from scratch.

limitations are that if user not turn on permission of location that not able to set coords of user
so for  that I have use geo suggestion so user can add location during leaving note.
also another limitation is google map keys are payed now i have used free one which will expire in few hits.
